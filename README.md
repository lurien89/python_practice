# python_practice

Hey! Here is where I will store my first steps in Python.

As you would see, I am new at this, so please don't judge my ugly code.

I am well aware that there are already functions implemented natively in the APIs, this projects are only for building muscle.

If you have any constructive criticism, suggestions or pointers, please don't hesitate in contacting me.
